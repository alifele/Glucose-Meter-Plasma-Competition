version 1
we know that there are three destinies for the light hiting sample.
1. oneone portion of the light will be scatterd from the surface.
(I hope it is not wave length dependent)
2. the other portion of light will be absorbed by sample and the tissue
of the sample holder
3. the last portion of light will reach the detector.

You can find a detailed schematic in the photo at this directory
