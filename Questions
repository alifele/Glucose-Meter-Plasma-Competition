1. What is the difference between:
	a. Selecting a part of light (using monochromator) and shining it on the sample and 
	measuring the absorbed coefficeint

	b. Shining the whole spectrum on the smaple and then using the grating after the smaple
	and comparing the the power on specific pixeles ( corresponding to the different colors)
